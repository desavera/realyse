The goal on this proposal is to avoid the need to either apply a full cartesian product on a JOIN between the two files or using particular and not guaranteed optimizied sorting approaches in order to merge the two contents which is the final goal of the problem.

For that we are going to use Delta Lake Merge functionality :

https://docs.delta.io/0.4.0/delta-update.html

which will basically give us an optimized merge implementation (this is Databricks experts in action) and where we have the MATCH we shall create a new entry for either dataframe so that we end up with a merged output.
